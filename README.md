# CS834_ResearchProject_Fall23
This repository contains the final research project materials for the CS 834 - Introduction to Information Retrieval course (Fall 2023).

The research project is associated with the Kaggle competition project 'Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets' (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nlp-getting-started/overview).

The aim of the project is to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which oneâ€™s are not. Additionally, we are required to incorporate some information retrieval method in the project as a requirement for the course.
